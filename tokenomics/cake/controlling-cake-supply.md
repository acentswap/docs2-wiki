# Controlling ADE supply

## Does ADE have a hard cap?

Yes, ADE now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/)

## How ADE supply is reduced

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into AcentSwap's products. The goal is for more ADE to leave circulation than the amount of ADE that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of ADE made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/#/pancake/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of ADE entering circulation from 40 ADE per block to 12.75. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, we want to still incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of AcentSwap's products (like a 10% burn of ADE spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the [**ADE Tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
